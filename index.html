            <p>I've always loved cooking but when my wonderful daughter Cara was born in 2015 I had to
                completely rethink how I
                approached it. <br><br>All of a sudden there was a hungry mouth with no teeth and a seemingly bottomless
                stomach
                in the
                house. Once she had left the bottle of milk and mushed up vegetable stage, I found myself trying to find
                different recipes that she would enjoy.<br><br> Some I found online, some I made up. Some were hits and
                some
                ended up as
                stubborn stains on the dining room wall.<br><br>I decided to write down these recipes so that one day I
                can
                share with
                her all her favourite recipes from growing and so Cara's Kitchen was born.<br><br> My hope is that when
                she's
                moved out
                and feels a bit homesick, she can look at these recipes, cook up something delicious and have a taste of
                home
                wherever she is. <br><br>Cara's still a kid as I write this so until that time comes I'm sharing these
                recipes
                with you
                and hoping you can get as much enjoyment out of them as she has.</p>
