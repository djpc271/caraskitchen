    <p id="about-text">I've always loved cooking but when my wonderful daughter Cara was born in 2015 I had to
        completely rethink how I
        approached it. <br><br>All of a sudden there was a hungry mouth with no teeth and a seemingly bottomless stomach in the
        house. Once she had left the bottle of milk and mushed up vegetable stage I found myself trying to find
        different recipes that she would enjoy.<br><br> Some I found online, some I made up. Some were hits and some ended up as
        stubborn stains on the dining room wall. I decided to write down these recipes so that one day I can share with
        her all her favourite recipes from growing and so Cara's Kitchen was born.<br><br> My hope is that when sheâ€™s moved out
        and feels a bit homesick, she can look at these recipes, cook up something delicious and have a taste of home
        wherever she is. <br><br>Cara's still a kid as I write this so until that time comes I'm sharing these recipes with you
        and hoping you can get as much enjoyment out of them as she has.</p>
