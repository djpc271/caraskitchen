        <p>I've always loved cooking but when my wonderful daughter Cara was born in 2015 I had to
            completely rethink how I
            approached it. <br><br>All of a sudden there was a hungry mouth with no teeth and a seemingly bottomless
            stomach
            in the
            house. Once she had left the bottle of milk and mushed up vegetable stage, I found myself trying to find
            different recipes that she would enjoy.<br><br> Some I found online, some I made up. Some were hits and
            some
            ended up as
            stubborn stains on the dining room wall.<br><br>I decided to write down these recipes so that one day I
            can
            share with
            her all her favourite recipes from growing and so Cara's Kitchen was born.<br><br> My hope is that when
            she's
            moved out
            and feels a bit homesick, she can look at these recipes, cook up something delicious and have a taste of
            home
            wherever she is. <br><br>Cara's still a kid as I write this so until that time comes I'm sharing these
            recipes
            with you
            and hoping you can get as much enjoyment out of them as she has.</p>
